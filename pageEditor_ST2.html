                <h2 id="home">Home Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>The SDG 3 Homepage is designed using HTML and CSS, implementing a structured layout with a
                    responsive and modern design. The page features a landing section with animated elements, a
                    video background with health related facts, and interactive cards presenting SDG 3's
                    Goals, Vision, and Mission. Key HTML tags such as `header`, `nav`, `main`, and `footer` structure
                    the content,
                    ensuring semantic clarity. The CSS utilizes Flexbox for alignment, animations for engaging visuals,
                    hover
                    effects for interactive elements, and media queries for responsiveness. The design
                    prioritizes user experience, readability, and accessibility, enhancing the
                    presentation of Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being. </p>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>The SDG 3 Homepage is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring an inclusive experience for
                    all users, including those with disabilities. Semantic HTML elements such as `
                    header`, `nav`, `main`, and `footer` structure the content for better screen reader
                    interpretation, while descriptive headings improve navigation. All images include
                    alt attributes, providing meaningful descriptions for visually impaired users. The
                    site supports keyboard navigation, ensuring interactive elements like buttons and
                    links are easily accessible. To enhance readability, the design maintains high color
                    contrast with dark green text on a light background, improving visibility for users
                    with low vision or color blindness. Additionally, the use of relative font sizes
                    (`rem`, `%`, `vw`, `vh`) ensures that text scales properly across different devices,
                    with CSS media queries optimizing responsiveness. ARIA attributes further
                    improve screen reader support, especially for dynamic elements such as tooltips and
                    animations. The homepage also avoids auto-playing audio, ensuring a user friendly
                    experience for those with sensory sensitivities. By incorporating these accessibility
                    features, the SDG 3 Homepage aligns with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility
                    Guidelines), making information about good health and well being accessible to a wider
                    audience. </p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="table">Table Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p> The table page is structured using semantic HTML elements such as `
                    table`, `thead`, `tbody`, `th`, and `td` to organize global health statistics. Font Awesome icons
                    enhance usability by providing
                    visual representation for categories like life expectancy and healthcare access. CSS
                    techniques include `border-collapse` for a cleaner table layout, `nth-child` selectors for
                    alternating row colors, and `hover` effects for interactivity. Tooltips implemented using
                    `position: relative` and `visibility: hidden` improve user experience by displaying
                    descriptions on hover. A shadow effect (`box-shadow`) adds depth to the table, while a
                    `flexbox` container ensures responsiveness and alignment.</p>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p> The page improves accessibility by using clear table headings, ensuring data is structured
                    in a logical order. The tooltip feature enhances comprehension for users with cognitive
                    disabilities. Font Awesome icons support visual cues but are supplemented with text to
                    maintain screen reader compatibility. High contrast between text and background ensures
                    readability, while hover effects provide visual feedback. The page is also responsive,
                    ensuring usability across different devices.

                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The content page is structured using semantic HTML elements such as `
                    main`, `section`, `h2`, and `p` to create a clear, readable format. CSS is used to enhance the
                    layout with `border-radius` and `box-shadow` for visually appealing sections. Floating
                    images (`float-left`, `float-right`) provide a dynamic text flow, while `padding` and
                    `margin` ensure proper spacing. A fixed-position "Go to Top" button improves navigation.
                    Font Awesome icons are used for visual emphasis, and the navigation bar links to related
                    pages for consistency.</p>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p> The page enhances accessibility through proper text contrast and readable font sizes.
                    Floating images include descriptive `alt` attributes for screen readers, ensuring
                    visually impaired users can understand the content. The structured layout with headings
                    and sections improves readability for assistive technologies. The "Go to Top" button
                    aids in navigation, particularly for users with mobility impairments. The responsive
                    design ensures usability across various devices, promoting inclusivity.

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    One significant challenge in the home page implementation was managing animations and transitions.
                    The @keyframes animations for text and floating hearts required performance optimization, as they
                    initially caused lag on lower-end devices. Optimizations included reducing animation duration and
                    limiting unnecessary reflows. Another issue was ensuring the video background didn't obstruct other
                    content. This was resolved using position: absolute along with a dark overlay (rgba(0,0,0,0.5)) to
                    improve text visibility.
                </p>
                <p>One challenge encountered while implementing the table page was ensuring proper table responsiveness.
                    Initially, the table overflowed on smaller screens, affecting readability. This was resolved by
                    adjusting the `width` to `95%` and applying a `border-collapse` property to maintain a structured
                    layout. Another issue was maintaining row visibility when using alternating colors; this was solved
                    by applying `nth-child(odd/even)` CSS selectors. Additionally, tooltip visibility was tricky due to
                    positioning conflicts, which were fixed using `position: relative` and `transform` animations.</p>
                <p>
                    A major challenge while developing the content page was managing image alignment within text blocks.
                    Floating images (`float-left`, `float-right`) initially disrupted text wrapping in smaller
                    viewports. This was resolved by adjusting `margin` properties and ensuring responsive behavior.
                    Another challenge was text readability against certain backgrounds, which was addressed by refining
                    color contrast and using `box-shadow` to create a visual separation.

            <section>
                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                <p>
                    The home page follows Janet regulations by ensuring accessibility through properly structured
                    navigation, readable text with high contrast, and scalable fonts. The floating elements are
                    carefully positioned to prevent interference with main content, and the video includes a fallback
                    mechanism to prevent disruption for users on unsupported devices.
                </p>
                <p>The table page follows Janet web regulations by ensuring structured data presentation using semantic
                    HTML elements (`thead`, `tbody`, `th`). It adheres to accessibility guidelines by using clear
                    contrast between text and background colors, providing tooltips for additional context, and
                    including alternative text for icons. The page maintains proper navigation structure with a
                    consistent header and footer.</p>
                <p>
                    The content page adheres to Janet regulations by structuring content with `
                    section` elements for readability and maintaining accessibility with proper heading levels (`h2`,
                    `p`). Images include `alt` attributes for screen readers, and a "Go to Top" button ensures better
                    page navigation. The page follows standard best practices for text contrast and font sizes.
                </p>

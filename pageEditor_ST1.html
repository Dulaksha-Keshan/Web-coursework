                    <p>
                        1. HTML Structure
                        The HTML structure of the Splash Screen is designed to provide a clear and visually appealing
                        introduction to the website. Below are the key HTML tags and their purposes:</br></br>

                        -meta charset="UTF-8" : Ensures the browser correctly interprets the text encoding, allowing for
                        proper display of special characters.

                        responsive by setting the viewport to the device's width, ensuring the layout adapts to
                        different screen sizes.
                        </br></br>
                        -title : Sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab.

                        global styles.
                        </br></br>
                        -style : Contains internal CSS specific to the Splash Screen, allowing for custom styling
                        without affecting other pages.
                        </br></br>
                        -div class="splash" : The main container for the splash screen content, styled to cover the
                        entire viewport and center the content.
                        </br></br>
                        -h1 : Displays the main title of the website, "GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING," with a large, bold
                        font to grab attention.
                        </br></br>
                        -p : Used for descriptive text, including the website's mission and group member names.
                        </br></br>
                        -h2 : A subheading for the group members section, providing a clear hierarchy in the content.
                        </br></br>
                        -div class="loader‚Äù: A spinning loader animation that indicates the page is loading before
                        redirecting to the home page.
                        </br></br>
                        -script : Contains JavaScript to automatically redirect the user to the home page after 3
                        seconds.
                        </br></br></br></br>

                        2. CSS Styling
                        The CSS styles are designed to create a visually engaging and responsive splash screen. Below
                        are the key CSS properties and their purposes:
                        </br></br>

                        - box-sizing: border-box; : Ensures that padding and borders are included in the element's total
                        width and height, preventing layout issues.
                        </br></br>
                        - body { margin: 0; overflow: hidden; }: Removes default margin and hides overflow to ensure the
                        splash screen covers the entire viewport without scrollbars.
                        </br></br>
                        - .splash: The main container for the splash screen content. It uses Flexbox to center the
                        content both vertically and horizontally. The background is set using a linear gradient overlay
                        on top of an image, creating a visually appealing and thematic backdrop.
                        </br></br>
                        - display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center; : Centers
                        the content both horizontally and vertically.
                        </br></br>
                        - height: 100vh; : Ensures the splash screen covers the entire viewport height.
                        </br></br>
                        - background: linear-gradient(...), url(...); : Applies a semi-transparent dark overlay on top
                        of a background image, enhancing readability of the text.
                        </br></br>
                        - color: white; : Sets the text color to white for contrast against the dark background.
                        </br></br>
                        - text-align: center; : Centers the text horizontally.
                        </br></br>

                        - h1 : Styles the main title with a large font size, bold weight, and a color that matches the
                        website's theme. The text shadow adds depth, making the title stand out.
                        </br></br>
                        - font-size: 4rem; : Large font size for emphasis.
                        </br></br>
                        - text-shadow: 2px 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); : Adds a shadow effect to the text for better
                        visibility.
                        </br></br>
                        - animation: fadeSlideIn 1s ease-out forwards; : Applies a fade-in animation to the title,
                        making it slide in from the bottom.
                        </br></br>
                        - p and h2 : These elements are styled with smaller font sizes and are animated to fade in after
                        the title appears, creating a smooth transition.
                        </br></br>
                        - animation: fadeIn 1.5s ease-in forwards; : Fades in the text after a delay, ensuring a smooth
                        visual flow.
                        </br></br>

                        - .loader : A CSS-based spinner animation that indicates the page is loading. It uses a circular
                        border with a spinning effect.
                        </br></br>
                        - border: 8px solid #f3f3f3; border-top: 8px solid #366f58; : Creates a circular loader with a
                        colored top border.
                        </br></br>
                        - animation: spin 2s linear infinite; : Rotates the loader continuously, creating a spinning
                        effect.
                        </br></br>

                        - Media Queries : Adjust the font sizes and layout for smaller screens to ensure the splash
                        screen remains visually appealing on mobile devices.
                        </br></br>
                        - @media (max-width: 768px) : Reduces font sizes and adjusts margins for better readability on
                        smaller screens.
                        </br></br></br></br>

                        3. JavaScript Functionality
                        </br></br>
                        - setTimeout(function () { window.location.href = "home.html"; }, 3000); : Automatically
                        redirects the user to the home page after 3 seconds, providing enough time to read the splash
                        screen content.
                        </br></br></br></br>

                        4. Key Design Choices
                        </br></br>
                        - Background Image and Gradient : The combination of a background image and a dark gradient
                        overlay ensures the text is readable while maintaining a thematic connection to the website's
                        focus on health and well-being.
                        </br></br>
                        - Animations : The fade-in and slide-in animations for the title and text create a smooth and
                        engaging user experience, making the splash screen more dynamic.
                        </br></br>
                        - Loader : The spinning loader provides visual feedback that the page is loading, enhancing the
                        user experience before the redirect to the home page.
                        </br></br>
                        - Responsive Design : Media queries ensure the splash screen looks good on all devices, from
                        desktops to mobile phones.
                        </br></br></br></br>

                        5. Accessibility Considerations
                        </br></br>
                        - Alt Text for Images : Although the background image is decorative, the text content is clearly
                        visible and readable, ensuring accessibility.
                        </br></br>
                        - Keyboard Navigation : The page is simple and does not require complex navigation, making it
                        accessible to users who rely on keyboards or screen readers.
                        </br></br>

                        This implementation ensures the splash screen is visually appealing, functional, and accessible,
                        providing a strong first impression of the website.
                    </p>
                    </br></br></br></br>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    </br></br>
                    <p>Accessibility is a critical aspect of web design, ensuring that all users, including those with
                        disabilities, can access and interact with the content. In the Splash Screen implementation,
                        several techniques were used to address accessibility:
                        </br></br></br></br>

                        1. Text Readability and Contrast
                        </br></br>
                        High Contrast Text: The text color (color: white;) is set against a dark background (using a
                        gradient overlay on the background image). This ensures high contrast, making the text easily
                        readable for users with visual impairments.
                        </br></br>

                        Text Shadow: The text-shadow property is applied to the main title (h1) to enhance visibility
                        further, especially against complex background images.
                        </br></br>

                        2. Responsive Design
                        </br></br>
                        Media Queries: The use of media queries ensures that the splash screen is responsive and adapts
                        to different screen sizes. This is particularly important for users who access the site on
                        mobile devices or with zoomed-in views.
                        </br></br>

                        Example: On smaller screens (max-width: 768px), the font sizes are reduced to ensure the text
                        remains readable without requiring horizontal scrolling.
                        </br></br>

                        3. Keyboard Navigation
                        </br></br>
                        Simple Layout: The splash screen has a simple layout with no interactive elements other than the
                        automatic redirect. This makes it easy for keyboard-only users to navigate, as there are no
                        complex interactions or forms that require keyboard focus management.
                        </br></br>

                        Automatic Redirect: The automatic redirect to the home page after 3 seconds is implemented using
                        JavaScript (setTimeout). While this is not directly related to keyboard navigation, it ensures
                        that users are quickly moved to the main content of the site.
                        </br></br>

                        4. Alternative Text for Images
                        </br></br>
                        Background Image: The background image is purely decorative and does not convey essential
                        information. Therefore, it does not require alternative text. However, the text content on the
                        splash screen is clearly visible and provides all necessary information.
                        </br></br>

                        Loader Animation: The loader animation is created using CSS and does not require alternative
                        text, as it is a visual indicator of the page loading process.
                        </br></br>

                        5. Semantic HTML
                        </br></br>
                        Use of Semantic Tags: Semantic HTML tags such as h1, h2, and p are used to structure the
                        content. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the content
                        hierarchy and read it in a logical order.
                        </br></br>

                        h1: The main title of the page, which is the most important heading.
                        </br></br>

                        h2: A subheading for the group members section, providing a clear hierarchy.
                        </br></br>

                        p: Paragraphs for descriptive text, including the website's mission and group member names.
                        </br></br>
                        </br></br>
                        6. Focus on Simplicity
                        </br></br>
                        Minimalist Design: The splash screen is designed to be simple and straightforward, with minimal
                        text and no complex interactions. This reduces the cognitive load for users with cognitive
                        disabilities and makes the content easier to understand.
                        </br></br>

                        Clear Purpose: The purpose of the splash screen is clearly communicated through the text
                        content, ensuring that users understand what the website is about before being redirected to the
                        home page.
                        </br></br>

                        7. Animation and Timing
                        </br></br>
                        Fade-In Animations: The fade-in animations for the text content are subtle and do not flash or
                        move rapidly, which could be problematic for users with vestibular disorders or epilepsy.
                        </br></br>

                        Timing: The animations are timed to ensure that the text appears gradually, giving users enough
                        time to read the content before the automatic redirect.
                        </br></br>

                        8. JavaScript Considerations
                        </br></br>
                        Graceful Degradation: The automatic redirect is implemented using JavaScript, but the page
                        remains functional even if JavaScript is disabled. Users will still see the splash screen
                        content and can manually navigate to the home page if needed.

                    <p>Accessibility is a critical aspect of web design, ensuring that all users, including those with
                        disabilities, can access and interact with the content. In the Volunteer page implementation,
                        several techniques were used to address accessibility. Below is a detailed explanation of how
                        accessibility was addressed in the provided code:
                        </br></br> </br></br>
                        1. Semantic HTML
                        </br></br>
                        Semantic HTML tags are used to provide a clear structure and meaning to the content, making it
                        easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to interpret the page.
                        </br></br>
                        -Headings (h1, h2, h3, etc.): Headings are used to create a logical hierarchy of content. For
                        example:
                        </br></br>
                        -h1: Used for the main heading of the page ("420 Volunteer programs found").
                        </br></br>
                        -h2: Used for subheadings like "Ratings and Reviews."
                        </br></br>
                        -h3: Used for individual program names (e.g., "Yoga Retreat Support").
                        </br></br>
                        This hierarchy helps screen readers navigate the page and understand the relationship between
                        different sections.
                        </br></br>
                        -Lists (ul, li): Unordered lists are used to display program details (e.g., duration, age
                        requirements). This ensures that screen readers can read the content in a structured manner.
                        </br></br>
                        -Tables (table , thead , tbody , th , tr , td ): Tables are used to display program fees in a
                        structured format. The use of thead and th ensures that screen readers can properly interpret
                        the table headers and data.
                        </br></br> </br></br>

                        2. Alt Text for Images
                        </br></br>
                        All images on the page include alt attributes, which provide alternative text descriptions for
                        screen readers. This ensures that users with visual impairments can understand the content of
                        the images.
                        </br></br>
                        Run HTML
                        </br></br>
                        -The alt attribute describes the image as "yoga retreat," which is read aloud by screen readers.
                        </br></br>
                        -Decorative Images: For purely decorative images (e.g., icons), the alt attribute is left empty
                        (alt="") to indicate that the image does not convey essential information.
                        </br></br> </br></br>

                        3. Keyboard Navigation
                        </br></br>
                        The page is designed to be fully navigable using a keyboard, ensuring that users who cannot use
                        a mouse can still interact with the content.
                        </br></br>
                        -Focusable Elements: All interactive elements (e.g., buttons, links, form inputs) are focusable
                        by default, allowing users to navigate through them using the Tab key.
                        </br></br>
                        -Dropdown Menu: The select element used for sorting programs is fully accessible via keyboard.
                        Users can navigate through the options using the arrow keys and select an option using the Enter
                        key.
                        </br></br> </br></br>

                        4. ARIA Attributes
                        </br></br>
                        ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes are used to enhance accessibility for
                        dynamic content and interactive elements.
                        </br></br>
                        ‚Ä¢ aria-label: Although not explicitly used in the provided code, ARIA labels can be added to
                        elements like buttons or icons to provide additional context for screen readers.
                        </br></br> </br></br>

                        5. Form Accessibility
                        </br></br>
                        The feedback form is designed to be accessible, with proper labels and input types.
                        </br></br>
                        -Labels for Input Fields: The label element is used to associate text labels with form inputs,
                        ensuring that screen readers can read the labels when the input is focused.
                        </br></br>
                        -Textarea for Feedback: The textarea element includes a placeholder attribute to provide
                        instructions for users.
                        </br></br>
                        -Emoji Buttons: The emoji buttons for rating are implemented as "button" elements, making them
                        accessible via keyboard.
                        </br></br> </br></br>

                        6. Contrast and Readability
                        </br></br>
                        The page uses high-contrast colors and readable fonts to ensure that the content is accessible
                        to users with visual impairments.
                        </br></br>
                        -Text Contrast: The text color (color: white;) is set against a dark background, ensuring high
                        contrast for readability.
                        </br></br>
                        -Button Contrast: Buttons like "Apply" and "View Project" use gradient backgrounds with
                        high-contrast text colors.
                        </br></br> </br></br>

                        7. Responsive Design
                        </br></br>
                        The page is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it is accessible on all devices, including
                        desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
                        </br></br>
                        -Media Queries: Media queries are used to adjust the layout and font sizes for smaller screens.
                        </br></br> </br></br>

                        8. Focus Indicators
                        </br></br>
                        Interactive elements like buttons and links have visible focus indicators, ensuring that users
                        navigating with a keyboard can see which element is currently focused.
                        </br></br> </br></br>

                        Summary
                        </br></br>

                        Summary
                        </br></br>
                        The Health and Well-Being content page is implemented using a combination of semantic HTML and
                        modern CSS techniques to create a visually appealing, interactive, and accessible user
                        experience. Key features include:
                        </br></br>
                        -A fixed navigation bar for easy section navigation.
                        </br></br>
                        -Smooth scrolling for a seamless user experience.
                        </br></br>
                        -Responsive images and layout for accessibility on all devices.
                        </br></br>
                        -A "Go to Top" button for quick navigation on long pages.
                        </br></br>
                        -A footer with links to other pages and social media icons.
                    </p>
                    </br></br></br></br>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>Accessibility is a critical aspect of web design, ensuring that all users, including those with
                        disabilities, can access and interact with the content. In the Health and Well-Being content
                        page implementation, several techniques were used to address accessibility. Below is a detailed
                        explanation of how accessibility was addressed in the provided code:
                        </br></br> </br></br>

                        1. Semantic HTML
                        </br></br>
                        Semantic HTML tags are used to provide a clear structure and meaning to the content, making it
                        easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to interpret the page.
                        </br></br>
                        -Headings (h1, h2, h3, etc.): Headings are used to create a logical hierarchy of content. For
                        example:
                        </br></br>
                        h1: Used for the main heading of the page ("Good health & Well Being").
                        </br></br>
                        h2: Used for subheadings like "Introduction," "Preventive Care," etc.
                        </br></br>
                        This hierarchy helps screen readers navigate the page and understand the relationship between
                        different sections.
                        </br></br>
                        -Lists (ul, li): Although not extensively used in this page, lists are a common way to structure
                        content for screen readers. In this page, the navigation links are structured as anchor tags
                        within a nav element, which is semantically correct for navigation.
                        </br></br>
                        -Sections (section): Each topic (e.g., "Introduction," "Preventive Care") is wrapped in a
                        section tag with a unique id. This allows screen readers to identify and navigate to different
                        sections of the page easily.
                        </br></br> </br></br>

                        2. Alt Text for Images
                        </br></br>
                        All images on the page include alt attributes, which provide alternative text descriptions for
                        screen readers. This ensures that users with visual impairments can understand the content of
                        the images.
                        </br></br>
                        -The alt attribute describes the image as "preventive care," which is read aloud by screen
                        readers.
                        </br></br>
                        Decorative Images: For purely decorative images (e.g., icons in the footer), the alt attribute
                        is left empty (alt="") to indicate that the image does not convey essential information.
                        </br></br> </br></br>

                        3. Keyboard Navigation
                        </br></br>
                        The page is designed to be fully navigable using a keyboard, ensuring that users who cannot use
                        a mouse can still interact with the content.
                        </br></br>
                        Focusable Elements: All interactive elements (e.g., buttons, links, form inputs) are focusable
                        by default, allowing users to navigate through them using the Tab key.
                        </br></br>
                        "Go to Top" Button: The "Go to Top" button is accessible via keyboard, allowing users to quickly
                        return to the top of the page.
                        </br></br> </br></br>

                        4. ARIA Attributes
                        </br></br> </br></br>
                        ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes are used to enhance accessibility for
                        dynamic content and interactive elements.
                        </br></br>
                        aria-label: Although not explicitly used in the provided code, ARIA labels can be added to
                        elements like buttons or icons to provide additional context for screen readers.
                        </br></br> </br></br>

                        5. Contrast and Readability
                        </br></br>
                        The page uses high-contrast colors and readable fonts to ensure that the content is accessible
                        to users with visual impairments.
                        </br></br>
                        Text Contrast: The text color (color: white;) in the header and footer is set against a dark
                        background, ensuring high contrast for readability.
                        </br></br>
                        Button Contrast: Buttons like the "Go to Top" button use gradient backgrounds with high-contrast
                        text colors.
                        </br></br> </br></br>

                        6. Responsive Design
                        </br></br>
                        The page is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it is accessible on all devices, including
                        desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
                        </br></br>
                        Media Queries: Media queries are used to adjust the layout and font sizes for smaller screens.
                        </br></br> </br></br>

                        7. Focus Indicators
                        </br></br>
                        Interactive elements like buttons and links have visible focus indicators, ensuring that users
                        navigating with a keyboard can see which element is currently focused.
                        </br></br> </br></br>

                        Summary
                        </br></br>
                        The Health and Well-Being content page addresses accessibility through:
                        </br></br>
                        -Semantic HTML for clear content structure.
                        </br></br>
                        -lt text for images to assist screen readers.
                        </br></br>
                        -Keyboard navigation for users who cannot use a mouse.
                        </br></br>
                        -ARIA attributes for dynamic content (though not extensively used in this implementation).
                        </br></br>
                        -High-contrast colors and readable fonts for users with visual impairments.

                    <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>During the implementation of the Splash Screen, Volunteer Page, and Content Page for the SDG 3
                        website, several challenges were encountered and resolved, leading to valuable lessons. For the
                        splash screen, synchronizing the text animation with the loader's timing was initially
                        problematic, resulting in abrupt transitions, but this was resolved by using setTimeout() and
                        CSS keyframe animations, which taught the importance of managing transitions effectively for a
                        smooth user experience. On the volunteer page, ensuring the responsive display of volunteer
                        cards on mobile devices posed a challenge as the cards did not resize properly. This was
                        addressed by using a flexbox layout with horizontal scrolling, along with media query
                        adjustments, highlighting the value of testing layouts across devices. The content page faced
                        layout issues with the navigation menu, particularly in maintaining proper alignment and
                        avoiding overflow on larger screens. A fixed sidebar and smooth scroll behavior were implemented
                        to resolve this, emphasizing the importance of designing intuitive user interfaces that enhance
                        both aesthetics and usability. These experiences underscored the need for careful planning,
                        testing, and refinement to achieve a polished, user-friendly website across different platforms.

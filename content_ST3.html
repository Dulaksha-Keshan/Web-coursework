            <p>The proper functioning of the body and its systems, enabling individuals to perform daily activities effectively and without undue fatigue. It is a fundamental aspect of overall wellbeing and involves maintaining the body through healthy habits and preventive care. Key components of physical health include regular exercise, which strengthens muscles, improves cardiovascular health, and boosts energy levels; a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients to support bodily functions and immune system strength; adequate sleep, which allows the body to repair and rejuvenate; and avoiding harmful behaviors like smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, or drug use. Regular health check-ups and screenings also play a vital role in early detection and prevention of diseases. Good physical health not only enhances quality of life but also supports mental and emotional wellbeing, creating a strong foundation for a fulfilling and active lifestyle.

It includes building strong relationships, practicing self-compassion, and developing emotional intelligence to handle challenges constructively. Activities like mindfulness, journaling, and seeking support from loved ones or professionals can enhance emotional health.

            <h2>4. Preventive Measures</h2>
            <p>Actions and strategies taken to avoid the onset of diseases, illnesses, or health issues before they occur. These measures focus on maintaining and improving health by reducing risk factors and promoting healthy behaviors. Examples include regular health check-ups, vaccinations, screenings for early detection of conditions like cancer or diabetes, and adopting a healthy lifestyle through balanced nutrition, regular exercise, and stress management. Preventive measures also involve avoiding harmful habits such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and drug use. Public health initiatives, such as promoting hygiene, clean water, and sanitation, also fall under this category. By prioritizing prevention, individuals can reduce the likelihood of chronic illnesses, improve quality of life, and decrease healthcare costs. Ultimately, preventive measures empower people to take control of their health and well-being, ensuring a healthier future for themselves and their communities.</p>

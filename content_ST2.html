            <h2>The Importance of Good Health and Well-Being</h2>
            <p>Health is not just the absence of disease; it is a complete state of physical, mental, and social well-being. SDG 3 emphasizes that every individual should have access to essential healthcare services, vaccinations, and treatments, regardless of their economic status or geographic location. In many parts of the world, preventable diseases continue to claim millions of lives, especially in underprivileged communities. Access to clean water, nutritious food, and adequate medical care remains a distant dream for many.</p>
            <p>Ensuring good health goes beyond just treating illnesses; it also includes preventive care, mental health support, and promoting healthy lifestyles. With increasing urbanization, people are experiencing higher stress levels, poor air quality, and unhealthy diets, which contribute to chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular problems. Governments and healthcare systems must work together to encourage wellness-oriented lifestyles through education and better public health policies.</p>

            <h2>Global Health Challenges and Their Impact</h2>
            <p>The world faces numerous health challenges that threaten progress in achieving SDG 3. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of healthcare systems globally, overwhelming hospitals, depleting medical supplies, and causing millions of deaths. While developed nations were able to roll out vaccines rapidly, many developing countries struggled with accessibility, highlighting the stark disparities in global health equity.</p>
            <p>Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cancer, diabetes, and respiratory disorders, are on the rise due to changing lifestyles and environmental factors. These diseases often require long-term medical care, making them expensive and difficult to manage in low-income nations. Addressing the root causes—such as smoking, poor diets, and lack of physical activity—can prevent the rise of these health problems.</p>

            <h2>The Role of Technology in Healthcare</h2>
            <p>Technological advancements are revolutionizing healthcare and offering solutions to long-standing challenges. Telemedicine has made it possible for patients in remote areas to consult with doctors online, reducing the need for physical visits to healthcare facilities. Mobile health applications are helping individuals track their fitness, monitor chronic conditions, and access medical advice instantly.</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is also transforming healthcare by enabling early disease detection, personalized treatment plans, and efficient medical data analysis. AI-powered diagnostic tools are helping doctors identify illnesses such as cancer at an early stage, leading to better treatment outcomes. Investing in health technologies and digital infrastructure is crucial for the future of medical care.</p>

            <h2>Addressing Mental Health as a Priority</h2>
            <p>Mental health is an often-overlooked aspect of overall well-being. Anxiety, depression, and stress-related disorders affect millions of people worldwide, yet mental health services are underfunded in many countries. The stigma surrounding mental illness prevents individuals from seeking help, worsening the problem.</p>
            <p>Promoting mental health awareness is key to achieving SDG 3. Schools, workplaces, and communities must foster environments that support emotional well-being. Accessible counseling services, workplace stress management programs, and community outreach initiatives can make a significant impact in addressing mental health issues.</p>

            <h2>How Individuals Can Contribute to SDG 3</h2>
            <p>Ensuring good health is not just the responsibility of governments and healthcare institutions; individuals also have a role to play. Here are some ways people can contribute:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i class="fas fa-user-md highlight"></i> Maintaining a balanced diet and staying physically active.</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-holding-medical highlight"></i> Getting regular health check-ups and vaccinations.</li>
